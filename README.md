#  Web Scraping Internshala Jobs using BeautifulSoup  

 
This project demonstrates web scraping by extracting internship/job listings from the Internshala website using **Python** and the **BeautifulSoup** library.  
 
Web Scraping is the process of automatically extracting information from websites.  
Instead of manually copying data, web scraping uses scripts to fetch and parse the HTML of a webpage to collect useful data.
